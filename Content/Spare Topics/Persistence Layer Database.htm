        <h1 class="Heading1">Persistence Layer / Database</h1>
        <p>Version 4.2. introduces new features such as user-level session statistics, canned responses and user/team management and session forwarding, which all require the presence of a persistence layer.</p>
        <p>This is why unblu 4.2 now introduces (persistent) database support for the on-premises version of the product. While it is possible to continue to run unblu without a database (unblu can run with an in-memory, embedded database in cases where no persistence layer is deployed but this is not officially supported), the system will ‘forget’ everything if the unblu Collaboration Server is restarted.</p>
        <p>The new persistence layer has increased the power of the unblu product by an order of magnitude. It is now possible to design your entire visitor-engagement strategy around the unblu Agent Desk.</p>
