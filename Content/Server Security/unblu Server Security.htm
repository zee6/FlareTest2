        <h1>unblu Server Security</h1>
        <p>This section covers on premises integrations and does not necessarily cover our cloud offering.</p>
        <h1><a name="System"></a>System Entry Path Concept</h1>
        <p>Unblu, by default, uses a set of entry paths (http request path prefix) as a high-level distinction for different kinds of requests. In typical on-premises installations these path prefixes are used as a high-level segregation for requests coming from different origins (public internet, intranet or from administrators / other systems). Based on these path prefixes, unblu grants different privileges while executing requests.</p>
        <p>In typical installations unblu is operated behind a reverse proxy that guarantees requests are restricted according to path prefix and origin of the request.</p>
        <h2>Public (untrusted) "/unblu" Entry Path</h2>
        <p>The "/unblu" path prefix is the part of the unblu server that visitors need to have access to. Typically "/unblu" is mapped in a reverse proxy in a way that it can be accessed from within the application that is going to be co-browsed.</p>
        <h2>Restricted (trusted) "/co-unblu" Entry Path</h2>
        <p>The "/co-unblu/" path prefix is the part of the unblu server that MUST only be accessible to authenticated users (agents).</p>
        <h2>System "/sys-unblu" Entry Path</h2>
        <p>The "/sys-unblu/" path prefix is the part of the unblu server that MUST only be accessible for other systems (i.e. the unblu filter) or administrators.</p>
        <h2><a name="Security"></a>Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>The "/sys-unblu/" path prefix needs to be protected in such a way that ensures that only administrators or other systems have access.</p>
