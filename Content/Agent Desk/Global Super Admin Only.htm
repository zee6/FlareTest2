        <h1>Global – Super Admin Only</h1>
        <p>The Agent Desk is designed to be self-documenting. This means that hovering over any configuration or text values produces either a plain language description or, in Advanced mode (by clicking the <span class="span_2">Advanced</span> button), a more technical description.</p>
        <p>Super Admins can still use configuration files or a command line to make changes but the Global page makes it much easier to make changes on-the-fly.</p>
        <p>unblu is almost infinitely configurable. It is also brand new. This means that use cases for the Agent Desk are rapidly evolving and we will be adding examples over time. </p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Note:</span> There is more information on how to set configuration items here: <a href="Settings Settings.htm#SettingsSettings"><span class="Hyperlink">Settings&gt; ... &gt; Settings</span></a> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>Global is the place where the Super Admin lives. No other role should get near this page as it contains every configuration available to the account. Also be aware that although the number of configuration items can seem overwhelming you will probably only have to change a small number of items to effect significant changes in behavior. Bear in mind that changes in the behavior of the system will affect the behavior of Agents, in terms of how they can interact with their visitor clients.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Note:</span> In the <span class="span_2">Options</span> filter at the top of the <span class="span_2">Global</span> page you can select <span class="span_2">Technical Labels</span> if you want to match these configuration values with the values in your <span class="span_4">config.properties</span> file.</p>
        <p>Below are the main general classifications of the configuration possibilities. These are exposed at the Admin level. We suggest that you work through these one-by-one until you get a feel for how these settings affect, or might affect, your process design.</p>
        <p>Agent Desktop Settings</p>
