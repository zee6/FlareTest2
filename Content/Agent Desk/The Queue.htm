        <p>The picture above uses only two entries to enhance clarity. In this scenario a Supervisor could see that two visitors have been waiting between two and four minutes to be attended to. The Queue offers a lot of information which can be further refined and/or broadened.</p>

                <p>With many agents and many simultaneous sessions the Queue can become unwieldy. If there are many visitors waiting you can apply filters to investigate those potential sessions that are most vital to you.</p>

                <p>Session forwarding is perhaps the most powerful feature of all as it allows all agents, regardless of role, to forward sessions to either another agent or another team. This is crucial to ensuring a timely and fruitful resolution to matching the right agent with a visitor. If your front-line visitor service agents are enabled to pinpoint the right agent or team within the organization this can have a dramatic effect on the success of each and every session. </p>
                <h3>Switch on Forwarding</h3>
                <p>Forwarding is not configured by default. Super Admins can switch on forwarding by following the steps below: </p>
                <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
                    <li>Select <span class="Bolder">Settings &gt; Global</span>&#160; then click the <span class="Bolder">Advanced</span> button. </li>
                    <li>From the <span class="Bolder">Options</span> drop-down list select <span class="Bolder">Inherited</span>.</li>
                    <li>From the <span class="Bolder">Match against</span> drop-down list select <span class="Bolder">Label</span>.</li>
                    <li>In the <span class="Bolder">Filter</span> field enter the word<span class="Bolder"> forward</span>. </li>
                </ol>
                <p><span class="Bolder">Note:</span> Session forwarding is ‘Role Agnostic’.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Agent_Desk_Pictures/The Queue_4.png" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 300px;" class="img_1" />
                </p>
                <ol start="5" class="ol_1">
                    <li>From the <span class="Bolder">CobrowsingFeatures &gt; sessionForwarding</span> drop-down list select <span class="Bolder">Both</span>. This will switch forwarding on for both agents and teams. If you do not want both switched on select either <span class="Bolder">Agents</span> or <span class="Bolder">Teams</span>.</li>
                    <li>Check the boxes<span class="Bolder"> forwardCookies</span> and <span class="Bolder">forwardReferer</span> then click <span class="Bolder">Save</span> to activate forwarding.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As alluded to earlier in this document, if a call comes in and a session is started it may be likely that the agent who answered the call cannot offer the type of service a particular visitor requires.</p>
                <p>It may even be that you decide that all visitors will first be ‘vetted’ by your front-line agents and then forwarded in a targeted manner so that you can maximize the value of each and every session. </p>
                <p>Note that this would be an example of the previously-mentioned ‘upside-down’ hierarchy, where the front-line agents, perhaps less skilled in nuanced financial services but experts in ‘handling’ clients, can ask a series of questions that enable them to forward the visitor to the ‘sweet spot’ in the system. Such a front-line would need to ‘see’ the relevant teams. It may even be that many sessions would be forwarded twice; the first to a relevant team and the next; from that specialist team to the most relevant, available, member of that team. </p>
                <p><span class="Bolder">Note:</span> Everyone can see everyone else, within the same account, when forwarding sessions. This means that registered users, who cannot normally see teams and team members thereof, are able to forward sessions to teams ‘upstream’ and to users upstream. This also means that whatever your process design, all of your agents have the ability to forward sessions to all of your agents all of the time. For example, a visitor who was just handled by the technical support team may now have a sales-related question and can be forwarded to the corresponding team or person.&#160;</p>
                <p><span class="Bolder">Note: </span>Session forwarding is virtually instantaneous, only limited by the speed of the network; to the visitor it seems entirely seamless.  </p>
