        <p><span class="Bolder">Note: </span>You must have Admin user rights in order to assign users/agents to teams.</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li>Select <span class="Bolder">Settings &gt; Users</span>. The <span class="Bolder">Users</span> page displays. </li>

        </p>
        <p>Choose the first user you want to assign to a team. In this example we will choose Registered User Ian Allsom. </p>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_1">
            <li>Select the pencil icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/Agent_Desk_Pictures/Creating Users_9.png" style="height: 19px;width: 18px;" class="img_1" />) to the right of the user’s name. The <span class="Bolder">Edit user</span> modal page slides in from the right of the screen.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <li>From the <span class="Bolder">Team</span> drop-down list select the team to which the user is to be assigned.</li>

        </p>
        <ol start="4" class="ol_1">
            <li>Click the <span class="Bolder">Save</span> button. Now if you check the <span class="Bolder">Users</span> page you will see that the user has been added to the team.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Note:</span> Members of a team do not show on the Teams page. To see which team a user is a member of go to the Users menu. You can group or filter users there to organize your teams.</p>
        <ol start="5" class="ol_1">
            <li>Repeat these steps until you have added all of your users to the appropriate teams.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Note:</span> Registered users cannot see each other on the Users page. In fact, there is no ‘User’s page’ as far as a Registered user is concerned. However, Registered users can see other users when they want to forward a visitor in the Queue, or an already-started session, to another agent or team. </p>
        <p>Supervisors can see all users who are members of his or her own team but not users allocated to other teams. Thus, the picture below shows the Customer help team from the view of a Supervisor. He can see himself (Alan Tester) and all registered users in his team.</p>
        <p class="p_8">

        </p>
        <p>The next picture shows an Admin view of all available teams. Note that the view is ‘Grouped by’ team. (Using the <span class="span_2">Group by</span> filter.)</p>
        <p class="p_8">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Agent_Desk_Pictures/Assigning Users to Teams_4.png" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 300px;" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>This is the more comprehensive view which is allocated to all Admin-level users by default. </p>
