        <p>The Live Agent Monitor allows supervisors to get a live snapshot of what is going on in the system. The page is tiled into four panels:</p>

        </p>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Service status:</span> Displays active domains, language used on those domains, and it displays the capacity for each listed domain.</p>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Agent availability:</span> Displays which agents are available, how many current sessions that agent is currently engaged in and how many additional sessions the agent can handle. In this example the agent dave@unblu.com still has two out of three slots left, Zoe is not involved in a session and has three available slots. The other agents shown in the picture are listed as Away.</p>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Active sessions:</span> Lists all current, active sessions. Scroll right to see how long the session has lasted, so far.</p>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Filtered chat queues:</span> Lists all chat queues, and their language, that have been filtered on the Queue page. This is useful if you want to see which domains/languages are currently most or least active.</p>
