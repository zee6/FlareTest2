        <h1>Statistics </h1>
        <p>While the Agent Monitor lets you see what is currently happening across your teams and users, the Statistics feature allows you to see what has already happened and has been logged. Registered users can only see their own data. Supervisors can see all team data, as can Admin users. </p>
        <p>In the main menu select<span class="Bolder"> Statistics</span>. The Statistics page displays.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The custom range can be defined using the two fields<span class="Bolder"> From</span> (date) and <span class="Bolder">To</span> (date)</p>

                <p>Use this to narrow your search. You can quite literally find anything on the page. More obvious examples would be to search for a name or a team but you can also search for a particular time (e.g., 10:15) or PIN or type or chat or even a part of a word or number. Indeed, anything you see, or imagine might be, on the page can be searched using the Filter field.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>There are seven options with which you can sort entries on the page.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../Resources/Images/Agent_Desk_Pictures/Statistics_2.png" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 300px;" class="img_1" />
                </p>
                <p>Note that sorting by Response time (as in the picture above) returns a list (drawn from the time period you set in the Display Range drop-down list) that runs from the fastest to the slowest responses. You can use a combination of filtering and sorting to hone-in on the information relevant to you. For example, within a given time range (set in Display Range) you could use the sort by Duration, filtering on an agent’s name to find out how long that agent spends on each session. Or substitute Duration for Response Time to see how long that agent (or indeed team; by entering the team name in the Filter field) takes to answer a request for a session. There are many combinatorial possibilities to explore and your business needs and desires will lead the way you use these features</p>
                <p><span class="Bolder">Note:</span> Sessions that are initiated using a PIN have no response time recorded. Currently, when you use filters to generate a list of response times the first entries may be ‘PIN’ sessions that record no response time. In order to see the results you want simply scroll down until you get to the results of all recorded sessions ordered from fastest (at the top of the list) to slowest (at the bottom of the list).</p>

                <p>If examining the Statistics on-the-fly is not enough, you can export the data to a CSV file. In fact, two files are generated and zipped:</p>
                <p>Chat-logt.csv</p>
                <p>Session-log.csv</p>
                <p>To generate the files, in the <span class="Bolder">Statistics</span> page click the <span class="Bolder">Export Data</span> button.</p>

                <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
                    <li>If you want to look at a particular session click on a ‘session’ on the <span class="Bolder">Statistics</span> page. (See the picture above for an example of a single session on the Statistics page.) The Session Log modal page slides in from the right.</li>

                </p>
                <p>This means you can analyze right down to the single session level and either share the information by mail or export to a text file. (See picture below.)</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Note that the ‘Zoe Zeller’ item says ‘no rating’. This is a record of the rating the visitor gave at the end of the session (1-5 stars). ‘No rating’ should probably be ignored but anything above that can be a useful tool to gauge how agents are perceived to have performed (by visitors) during each individual session.</p>
