        <h1>How to determine if your web page is being displayed inside the unblu browser</h1>
        <p><span class="Bolder">Note: </span>This is a very specific use case. The problem this script solves is: How do you know if you are within an unblu universal co-browsing session or not?</p>
        <p>If you have a page, for example, that should be in any way different when you are using universal co-browsing then you can use this script to find out whether you are in a universal co-browsing session or not. For example, if you wanted an area on a page to contain special links, or additional information, that only display when you have started a universal co-browsing session you would use this script to tell you if you are in a universal co-browsing session inside the unblu browser.</p>
        <p>The script checks whether you are inside the unblu browser in order that the code you have written that is intended to be universal co-browse-specific will execute in the right place.</p><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
if( typeof(unbluBrowser) != "undefined" &amp;&amp; unbluBrowser.log) {
 
    // Your code that runs when within a co-browse session
    // e.g. Load additional CSS
}
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
